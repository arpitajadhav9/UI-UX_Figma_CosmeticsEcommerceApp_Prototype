# UI-UX_Figma_CosmeticsEcommerceApp_Prototype

## WELCOME TO MY COSMETICS E-COMMERCE UI PROTOTYPE!

### HEY THERE!

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find the high-fidelity and mid-fidelity prototypes I crafted on Figma, inspired by three amazing cosmetics e-commerce apps: **Tira**, **Purplle**, and **Sugar**.

### ABOUT THIS PROJECT

I embarked on a fun and insightful journey comparing Tira, Purplle, and Sugar to understand what makes their design and user experience stand out. Taking the best elements from each, I created a unique UI that blends their strengths while adding a fresh twist of my own. My goal was to design an interface that's not only visually stunning but also user-friendly and intuitive.

### WHAT YOU'LL FIND

- **HIGH-FIDELITY PROTOTYPE**: This is the polished, detailed version of the design, complete with the right colors, typography, and spacing to give you a real feel of the final product.
- **MID-FIDELITY PROTOTYPE**: These are more about layout and functionality, offering a clear vision of the appâ€™s structure without the distraction of detailed visuals.
