# UI-UX_Figma_CosmeticsEcommerceApp_Prototype

## WELCOME TO MY COSMETICS E-COMMERCE UI PROTOTYPE!

### HEY THERE!

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find the high-fidelity and mid-fidelity prototypes I crafted on Figma, inspired by three amazing cosmetics e-commerce apps: **Tira**, **Purplle**, and **Sugar**.

### ABOUT THIS PROJECT

I embarked on a fun and insightful journey comparing Tira, Purplle, and Sugar to understand what makes their design and user experience stand out. Taking the best elements from each, I created a unique UI that blends their strengths while adding a fresh twist of my own. My goal was to design an interface that's not only visually stunning but also user-friendly and intuitive.

### WHAT YOU'LL FIND

- **High-Fidelity Prototype**: This is the polished, detailed version of the design, complete with the right colors, typography, and spacing to give you a real feel of the final product.
- **Mid-Fidelity Prototype**: These are more about layout and functionality, offering a clear vision of the appâ€™s structure without the distraction of detailed visuals.

### TOOLS USED

- **Figma**: My go-to tool for bringing these designs to life, allowing for seamless collaboration and iteration.

### DIVE IN!

Take a look around and explore the different screens and components of my prototypes. Each design decision was made with the user in mind, aiming to create a delightful shopping experience in the cosmetics e-commerce world.

### LET'S CONNECT

I'd love to hear your thoughts! Whether it's feedback, suggestions, or just a chat about UI/UX design, feel free to open issues or contribute to the project with pull requests.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my designs as much as I enjoyed creating them!
